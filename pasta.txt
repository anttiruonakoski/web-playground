To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to play Team Fortress 2. The mechanics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the techniques will go over a typical player's head. There's also Medic's schadenfreude outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Reddit literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these mechanics, to realize that they're not just fun- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Team Fortress 2 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Heavy's existencial catchphrase "Pootis," which itself is a cryptic reference to the Engineer's dispenser. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Robin Walker's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚ And yes by the way, I DO have a Medic and Heavy fanfic tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the Medics' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 1 tier of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
